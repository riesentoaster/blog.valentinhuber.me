Hi! I'm Valentin Huber. I like computers, guitars, bikes, music and podcasts. You'll find me writing about these and any other topic I might take an interest in.

I'm currently studying computer science at [ZHAW](https://zhaw.ch). I graduated Schaffhausen's High School and completed my civil service in a school, a soup kitchen, an industrial kitchen and an IT departement. I completed [Youth2Engineer](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/study/pre-college/) at ZHAW and an internship at [Syntegon](https://syntegon.com).
