title: "Challenges and Mitigation Strategies in Symbolic Execution Based Fuzzing Through the Lens of Survey Papers"
---
In a security seminar at MSE I surveyed existing review papers on symbolic execution-based fuzzing and wrote my own survey paper. I focused on fundamental challenges that symbex introduces in fuzzing and classified the approaches I found to mitigate them into several categories. The work is available [here](https://github.com/riesentoaster/review-symbolic-execution-in-fuzzing/releases/download/v1.0/Huber-Valentin-Challenges-and-Mitigation-Strategies-in-Symbolic-Execution-Based-Fuzzing-Through-the-Lens-of-Survey-Papers.pdf).
