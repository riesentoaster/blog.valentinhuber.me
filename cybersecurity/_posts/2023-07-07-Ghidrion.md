For my bachelor's thesis, Silvan Flum and I developed Ghidrion, a plugin for Ghidra that allows the use of Morion, a suite of tools to use symbolic execution.

The full thesis is [here](/assets/ghidrion.pdf). Ghidrion is open source and can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/silvan-flum/ghidrion).
