title: Live Albums
---
I'm a big fan of well-done live recordings and over the past years, my mind has accumulated a list of great live albums, from all over the genre spectrum, in no particular order:

## John Mayer — Where the Light Is: Live in Los Angeles
This list has to start with [this album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Light_Is_(John_Mayer_album)). John Mayer playing a mixture of his best songs, and ripping some of his best guitar solos ever, in my opinion. I also love how he plays songs in vastly different settings: Starting out with just him and his acoustic guitar, then with Robbie Mcintosh and David Ryan Harris adding more acoustic (slide) guitars, gorgeous acoustic pop. Oh, and don't miss the amazing cover of Free Fallin'! Then, he plays a set in a classic rock trio: guitar, bass (Pino Palladino), and drums (Steve Jordan). Really shows his roots in blues and plays two Hendrix covers. Finally, he brings out the full band for a total of more than two hours of music.

This may just be my favorite ever live album.

## David Gilmour — Live at Pompeii
I'm not sure why [this album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_Pompeii) has been my go to for music by Pink Floyd, but it is. David Gilmour certainly brings the guitar magic and the songs are just timeless classics. 

## Watchhouse — Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater
I've been lucky enough to have seen Watchhouse live a few years ago. And it's the definition of relaxing summer night music for me. There is so much space in their music, and so much intention in every note played or sung. And once they released a [recording of a concert](https://watchhouse.bandcamp.com/album/austin-city-limits-live-at-the-moody-theater-3), it took about half a song to ensure a permanent place on this list.

## Steven Wilson — Home Invasion: In Concert at the Royal Albert Hall
Steven Wilson plays a mix of his solo work and old Porcupine Tree songs on [this album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Invasion:_In_Concert_at_the_Royal_Albert_Hall). It's a great introduction into prog rock, with some almost pop songs ranging to complex prog arrangements. Oh, and some more simply amazing guitar work (anybody notice this is written by a guitarist?).

## Alison Krauss & Union Station — Live
Very different, yet still very beautiful [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_(Alison_Krauss_album)) by maybe the best voice in bluegrass. And it certainly doesn't hurt that her band is a who-s-who of bluegrass musicians, including Jerry Douglas, *the* defining dobro player.

## Alter Bridge — Live at the Royal Albert Hall
I'm not a big metalhead, I don't really like screamed vocals. But since Alter Bridge doesn't do that (quite the opposite actually, they do some impressive clean rock singing), [this album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_the_Royal_Albert_Hall_(featuring_The_Parallax_Orchestra)) makes the list. Oh, and metal with an orchestra is almost almost a recipe for a great album.

## Dire Straits — Alchemy
It's [Dire Straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy:_Dire_Straits_Live). 'nuff said. 

## Vulfpeck — Live at Madison Square Garden
This may be the funniest and most entertaining [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulfpeck#Studio_albums_and_Live_at_Madison_Square_Garden) of this list. It's dirtily clean funk from a band with a great sense of humour and lots of great guest artists.

## Florence + the Machine – Symphony of Lungs - BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall
For some reasons, concerts live at the Royal Albert Hall often are just spectacular. I particularly love the arrangements of [this concert](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ksqzwzZ1VpB_AvJzUTk1-GqZnOmA3ZPxA) by Jules Buckley and his orchestra. If you look for it, you may also find the video online, which is worth a watch.

## Honorable Mentions
These didn't quite make the list for different reasons:
- Lawrence — The Live Album: It feels too much like a desk recording, the production isn't quite up to where the other albums on this list are and there's too much crowd interaction to flow as an album in my opinion.
- Pretty much the same applies to Cardinal Black's Live at the Memo. It's probably been a great live show (well, I've seen that same show, and it *is* great), but the live recording isn't quite up there.
- John Mayer played two live shows in CMT's Crossroads series with Keith Urban and Brad Paisley respectively. I can't find them released as actual albums, but there are videos available and worth a watch.
- There are a few videos out there from Jamie Cullum Live From Jazz a Vienne. From full-on big band jazz to straight-up pop songs and everything in between, I keep finding myself coming back to them. But I don't think he released them as an actual album.
