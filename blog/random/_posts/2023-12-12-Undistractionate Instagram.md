title: Undistractionate Instagram
---

Instagram is great at sucking as much time out of you as possible. While I enjoy seeing what people I know get up to, I find myself spending hours looking at random reels that add little value to my life. So I wrote a quick adblock list to block the app parts I don't actually want to see. Specifically, it blocks:
- The "Explore" tab
- The "Reels" tab
- Any suggested posts after you've seen all posts from accounts you follow

The downside of using this system is that you will not be able to use the official Instagram app anymore but need to use the browser version. Adding the website to your homescreen (as a [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)) makes it a bit easier to use, but it still handles less smoothly than the app.

To use this, follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/riesentoaster/instagram-adblock/).
