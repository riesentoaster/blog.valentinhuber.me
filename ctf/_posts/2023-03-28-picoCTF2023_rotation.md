## Solution

The challenge title indicates some form of rotation cipher, so I put the encoded text into [cyberchef](https://icyberchef.com) and used the `ROT13 Brute Force` module to rotate the text. A quick text search on the output showed that the encoding is a rotation by 18 chars and the flag is `picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_429af00f}`.
