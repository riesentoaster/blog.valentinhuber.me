## Challenge

> Um...I forgot my password. Sorry. You're a hacker - can you get in?

The provided website contains a single password field and a login button. Whatever password is entered is wrong.

## Solution

The HTML of the website contains the following comment:

```html
<!-- backup source located at source.txt -->
```

source.txt contains:

```php
<?php
    $FLAG = (file_get_contents("/challenge_flag.txt"));
    $PASSWORD = (file_get_contents("/challenge_flag.txt"));

    if(isset($_POST['password'])) {
        if(strcmp($PASSWORD, $_POST['password']) == 0) {
            $success = true;
        }
        else {
            $success = false;
        }
    }
    else {
        $success = false;
    }

    if ($success) {
        echo "<h1>Congratulations!</ha>";
        echo "<p>Your flag is: $FLAG</p>";
    }
    else {
        echo "<h1>Password incorrect.</h1>";
    }
?>
```

The vulnerability we exploited is in the `strcmp`. Assuming `$PASSWORD` is a string, if we can manage to pass any other type to `$_POST['password']`, `strcmp` returns `NULL`, which is equal to `0`, since we don't check types (`==` as opposed to `===`). This can be done by sending an array to the server.

The easiest way to do this is by modifying the `name` attribute of the password `input` element of the original website from `password` to `password[]`. Then we enter anything into the password field, send it to the server and get:

```
Warning: strcmp() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in /var/www/html/login.php on line 6
Congratulations!
Your flag is: flag{strcmp_bypass_ftw}
```
