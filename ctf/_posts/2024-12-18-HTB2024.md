title: Hack the Box University CTF 2024

I really enjoyed [playing the Hack the Box University CTF 2024 with Team Frack at ZHAW](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7275092454410792960/). It was nice taking a break from working on my master's thesis, open a decompiler, and have some fun.

I mostly worked on some reverse engineering challenges, running through the easy and medium difficulty challenges quite quickly. And while I didn't quite solve the hard challenge, I particularly enjoyed that it includes analyzing a binary containing instructions in multiple, different instruction sets, thus rendering na√Øve use of disassemblers and decompilers partially useless. What a creative way to make the challenge harder!
