## Challenge

## Solution

We are presented with a pyc file. It is a compiled binary of a python script, so the first step is to decompile it. This turned out to be harder than expected, but [Decompyle++](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc) worked and produced [this python script](/assets/ctf/tcp1p2023/chall.py).

At this point I tried to get this to run by deleting all the GUI instructions and replacing them with fixed calls. But I didn't manage to achieve this and instead opted to write a second implementation that mirrored the logic I observed in the original. To do this, I first had to understand what the code does. The snippets below are from the decompiled code and still have the errors in them.

### A few observations

#### Flag and decryption

```python3
FLAG = [ 90, 19, 95, 37, 58, 144, 131, 222, 253, 162, 107, 96, 98, 128, ...

# ---

def decrypt(key, plain):
    dec = ''
    key = long_to_bytes(int(''.join(key), 2))
    for i in range(len(key)):
        dec += chr(key[i] ^ plain[i])
    return dec
```
- We have an array of bytes called `FLAG` and a decryption function which takes a key and a ciphertext (for some reason called `plain` here, probably because encryption and decryption are the same) and XORs them together. This means we are likely looking for a key of the same length as `FLAG`.

#### Random

```python3
import random
turn = 0
random.seed(199)

# ---

num = (lambda .0: [ i for i in .0 ])(range(1, 1001))
init = num.copy()
random.shuffle(init)
random.shuffle(init)
random.shuffle(init)

# ---

target = init.copy()
target.remove(troot.data)
random.shuffle(target)
```

- We seed `random`, and then use it to shuffle an array in a repeatable manner.

#### Trees

```python3
class Node:
    __qualname__ = 'main.<locals>.Node'
    
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.l = None
        self.r = None
        self.height = 1
```

- Binary trees!

```python3
def insert(self = None, root = None, key = None):
    if not root:
        return Node(key)
    if None < root.data:
        root.l = self.insert(root.l, key)
    else:
        root.r = self.insert(root.r, key)
    root.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(root.l), self.getHeight(root.r))
    b = self.getBal(root)
    if b > 1 and key < root.l.data:
        return self.rRotate(root)
    if None < -1 and key > root.r.data:
        return self.lRotate(root)
    if None > 1 and key > root.l.data:
        root.l = self.lRotate(root.l)
        return self.rRotate(root)
    if None < -1 and key < root.r.data:
        root.r = self.rRotate(root.r)
        return self.lRotate(root)
```

### Figuring out what is happening

#### Submit

```python3
def submit(root = None):
    global turn, turn
    
    try:
        u = inp.get()
        if not tr.check(0, root, u, target[turn]):
            turn = 0
            validatedkey.clear()
        else:
            showinfo('W rizz', 'Correct!', **('title', 'message'))
            validatedkey.append(u)
            inp.delete(0, 'end')
            turn += 1
        if turn == len(target):
            showinfo('dayummm', decrypt(validatedkey, FLAG), **('title', 'message'))
    finally:
        pass
    except SyntaxError:
        showerror('Error', 'Invalid input!', **('title', 'message'))
```

- `submit` is called from within the GUI and is the only time the GUI interacts with the rest of the code. So it's a good starting point.
  - It takes a variable called `root` (so probably a tree) and an input from the GUI (`inp.get()`).
  - It then calls `tr.check`.
    - If it fails, it prints an error message and resets the program.
    - If it succeeds, a variable called `turn` is incremented and the input is marked as valid. The system then waits for the next input.
    - If all necessary inputs were provided and the check for each returned `true`, the flag is decrypted and printed.

#### Check

```python3
def check(self, state, root, n, x):
    state = root
    for i in n:
        if i == '0':
            state = state.l
        elif i == '1':
            state = state.r
        if state == None:
            showwarning('sike', 'Error invalid node!\nResetting level...', **('title', 'message'))
            return False
        if state.data == x:
            return True
        None('wuat de hell', 'Wrong answer! \nResetting level...', **('title', 'message'))
        return False
        return None
```

- The check function takes
  - A `state` variable (which is immediately overwritten)
  - A `root` (so presumably a tree)
  - A `n` (the input for the step to check)
  - `x`, the value to check against
- It then loops over the input and traverses down the tree according to the input.
- Finally, it checks whether the node where we ended up matches the value passed in `x`.

### Solving the challenge

I pulled a working implementation of an AVL tree in python from the internet. It's a fairly standard data structure so implementations are easy to find.

- The challenge is set up in a way where a randomly sorted array is iteratively added to the AVL tree (which makes it so that you cannot reasonably predict where exactly each node is located).
- The array is then shuffled once more.
- Finally, for each value in the array, we have to calculate the path of the node with the corresponding value in the tree.

```python3
def getPath(self, value, root):
    if not root or value == root.data:
        return ''
    if value > root.data:
        return '1' + self.getPath(value, root.r)
    else:
        return '0' + self.getPath(value, root.l)
```

- `getPath` takes a tree and a value and recursively calculates the path through the tree for the specified value in the form necessary for `check`.
- We also need the same setup as the original has:

```python3
# Setting up the random array
init = list(range(1, 1001))
random.seed(199)
random.shuffle(init)
random.shuffle(init)
random.shuffle(init)

# Creating the tree and feeding it the shuffled array.
tr = AVLTree()
root = None
for i in init:
    root = tr.insert(root, i)

# Creating target
target = init.copy()
target.remove(root.data)
random.shuffle(target)
```

- We then calculate the paths for all the inputs:

```python3
# Calculating paths
input = [list(tr.getPath(e, root)) for e in target]
```

- And finally validate our input and decrypt the flag:

```python3
# Calling check repeatedly
turn = 0
validatedKey = []

while True:
    if not tr.check(0, root, input[turn], target[turn]):
        print('error at', turn)
        exit(1)
    else:
        validatedKey.append(input[turn])
        turn += 1
    if turn == len(target):
        print(decrypt([''.join(e) for e in validatedKey], FLAG))
        exit(0)
```
