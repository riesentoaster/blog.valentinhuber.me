## Solution

I first looked at the unicode numbers for the provided chars:

```
0x7c6f
0x7c75
0x7c6a
0x7c70
0x7c84
0x7c7b
0x7c39
0x7c7d
0x7c7d
0x7c3c
0x7c77
0x7c7d
0x7c39
0x7c7d
0x7c71
0x7c3c
0x7c6c
0x7c39
0x7c7b
0x7c3c
0x7c86
```

They obviously are very close together. The first thought was that it would just be about the last two chars, but this way, the flag string would start with `o`, which is wrong.

I then thought it might be a constant offset to ASCII, which turned out to be correct. Python code:

```python3
input = "籯籵籪籰粄类簹籽籽簼籷籽簹籽籱簼籬簹类簼粆"
diff = ord(input[0])-ord('f')
print('offset:', hex(diff))
r = ''
for e in input:
    r += chr(ord(e)-diff)

print('flag:', r)                                                                         
```

Output:

```
offset: 0x7c09
flag{r0tt3nt0th3c0r3}
```
